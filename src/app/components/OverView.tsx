        Kohli&apos;s playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait
        that extends to his leadership on the field. Kohli is known as a skilled
        batsman who plays with determination and energy. In one-day cricket, he
        usually bats at number three and stands with his chest slightly open and
        holds the bottom of his bat firmly. He&apos;s praised for his quick
        footwork, wide range of shots, and his talent for leading innings,
        especially in high-pressure situations. Instead of trying to hit big
        shots, Kohli prefers to play safe shots close to the ground. People
        admire his ability to make wrist shots and consistently perform well in
        the mid-wicket and cover areas. Kohli is known for his composed batting
        technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off
        and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to
        display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple
        wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt
        traditional field positioning.[6]

        Virat Kohli first came into the limelight in 2008, when he led the
        Indian U-19 cricket team to victory in 2008 U-19 Cricket World Cup. He
        soon made his debut for the Indian team in August 2008, during a ODI
        match against Sri Lanka.[10] In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot
        in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time.[11] Virat also
        became one of the valuable Indian captain in Test cricket with 40 test
        wins, 16 of which came overseas and gained highest winning percentage as
        captain in both Tests and ODIs. Kohli was ranked eighth in ESPN&apos;s
        list of world&apos;s most famous sportspeople in 2016.[12] Virat is the
        only current player to have a stand named after him in Delhi&apos;s
        Firoz Shah Kotla stadium to Honour his contributions to Indian cricket.
        Kohli won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year
        awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same
        year.[13]

      <p className="z-30">
        A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading
        India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008.
        In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own
        hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, &apos;bad-boy&apos;
        intensity, would clearly be an outcast.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">
        Grind Through the Ranks
      </h1>
      <p className="z-30">
        He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In
        the absence of the regular openers, Virat Kohli was given a chance to
        open the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in
        his extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series.
        However, the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag
        kept Kohli out of the team
      </p>
      <p className="z-30">
        The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks,
        clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; that
        junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to
        Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his
        authority all over the bowling attacks. He added &apos;big-match
        temperament&apos; to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the
        final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory.
        The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match
        champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two
        centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in the
        selectors&apos; minds.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">
        Cementing a national spot
      </h1>

      <p className="z-30">
        The selectors had no choice but to give Kohli another go in the Indian
        side, and this time he strung together a number of impressive scores.
        After being given an extended run, he repaid their faith by notching up
        his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka in
        December 2009 - his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases. In the
        World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of them all, Kohli, along
        with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated
        rescue effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early. This
        knock played a crucial role in setting the platform for MS Dhoni&apos;s
        fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on that
        enchanting evening in Mumbai.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">
        A baptism by fire Down Under
      </h2>

      <p className="z-30">
        The selectors and the captain persisted with him going into the 3rd
        Test, and he delivered a break-through performance on a bouncy Perth
        wicket - an impressive 75 - where a visible change in technique was
        visible. He managed to stand tall, with a more open stance, and
        exhibited the back-foot shots in his repertoire during the course of the
        innings. The volatile Kohli managed to overshadow his impropriety in
        conduct with his performance in the final Test of the series. Notching
        up India&apos;s only century of a disastrous tour, Kohli was the shining
        light in amidst the chaos, as he stroked his way to a hundred in
        Adelaide exhibiting the will to improve and extraordinary focus under
        pressure in the searing heat and pressure of Australia.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">
        That break-through innings…
      </h2>

      <p className="z-30">
        We remember the accolades, but where did it all begin? There&apos;s
        always the one innings that made the world sit up and take notice; the
        86-ball knock which he started off as a brash boy, but ended as a man.
        Chasing an improbable target of 321 off 40 overs to stay alive in the
        tournament, he laid into the Sri Lankan bowlers and carted his way to
        133*, getting India home with more than 2 overs to spare, practically
        pulling them out of the airport after M.S. Dhoni rather ignorantly
        remarked that India had already been eliminated from the tournament.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">
        Batting technique and idiosyncrasies
      </h2>

      <p className="z-30">
        Kohli has a seemingly hot head on his shoulders, but he channels all his
        anger while he is batting. Known to be an aggressive batsman always on
        the lookout for runs, he has a fairly sound , albeit slightly
        unconventional technique, which makes him judge the length of the ball
        earlier than most, and amazingly quick wrists to run his hands through
        the ball, even against fast bowlers. He is equally adept against pace
        and spin, and never looks ungainly at the crease. With nimble
        foot-movement against the spinners, he is known to be quite destructive
        when the situation demands it. He has had to fill some rather big shoes
        of his predecessors, and has done an admirable job to say the least.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">
        Captaincy and a change in technique
      </h2>

      <p className="z-30">
        With regular captain MS Dhoni ailing from an injury, Kohli was named
        stand-in captain for the first Test at Adelaide. After an abysmal tour
        of England, critics were sceptical of Kohli&apos;2s performance in
        Australia in the Border-Gavaskar trophy in December. Kohli proved that
        they couldn&apos;t have been more wrong, as he scored two fluent
        hundreds in the first Test at Adelaide. His second innings masterclass
        of 141 almost pulled off a stunning run-chase on a notorious 5th day
        rank-turner, and went on to score a total of four hundreds on this tour.
        Saying that he had silenced critics would be an understatement.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">The final frontier</h2>

      <p className="z-30">
        In the first week of 2018, Kohli went on to lead India in South Africa,
        a few weeks after he tied the knot with Indian actress and long-time
        girlfriend, Anushka Sharma. India went on to concede the series in the
        first two Tests, but came back to win the third Test match on a
        difficult wicket. In a series full of difficult wickets, Kohli exhibited
        tighter technique than he had in England, and batted better than he did
        in his more prolific tour of South Africa in 2013/14. Kohli went on to
        conquer his (personal) final frontier in England later in 2018 too,
        scoring 593 runs in 10 innings, including 2 hundreds, and not conceding
        his wicket to his fabled nemesis, Anderson, even once. India went on to
        lose the series 1-4, and Kohli&apos;s record as captain was tainted by
        two consecutive Test series losses away.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-500">IPL through the years</h2>

      <p className="z-30">
        Ahead of the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League Virat Kohli
        showed how much faith he had in the franchise by declaring that he would
        perhaps end his career with the Bangalore-based Royal Challengers. The
        only player to be a part of a single franchise for the entire duration
        of the tournament (right from the start of the cash-rich league in
        2008), Kohli has developed an affection with the franchise and with the
        fans over the period of time.
